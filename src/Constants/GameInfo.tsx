      <h3>Defuse: The Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Gather round, people! It's time to put your nerves to the test and save the day. You're on a mission to defuse a
        bomb before time runs out, and you're going to need to work together to make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>Here's the deal</p>
      <p>
        There are 6 colorful wires that need to be cut in the right order to defuse the bomb. But the instructions on
        how to do it are scattered amongst you players. So, you'll need to communicate and coordinate like a well-oiled
        machine to make sure you're following the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure you're following the instructions carefully. If you cut the wrong wire or cut them out of order, you
        could activate the bomb, and that's game over. You're also working against the clock, so you'll need to act fast
        and work efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>Remember, you're a team, so listen to each other and respect the instructions you've been given.</p>{' '}
      <p>Communication is key!</p>
      <p>Now, let's get to it! The fate of all good people rests in your hands.</p>

      <h3>Vote: The Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Attention all players! It's time to put your camaraderie to the acid test with Vote. This multiplayer game will
        reveal the true colors of your friends, but fret not, victory is but a mere afterthought. The real goal is to
        have a jolly good time, filled with cheeky banter and intriguing anecdotes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each round, a question shall be posed, for instance "Who is most likely to purchase a scarlet sports car?" and
        then it will be your duty to vote for the individual you believe fits the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        But beware, the catch is that you'll only earn a point for your vote if it coincides with the general consensus.
        Hence, choose wisely!
      </p>

      <p>
        This jamboree is all about making merry and getting to know one another a bit better. So, bring your wit and a
        hearty laugh, and get ready for some old-fashioned hijinks. And remember, no matter the outcome, you'll
        (probably) still be friends till the end.
      </p>

      <p>Alright, let the games begin! Who's ready for the challenge?</p>

      <h3>Charlatan: The Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Charlatan, the cheeky multiplayer game where you will have to outsmart each other and sniff out the
        game's sneaky Charlatan. This game is good fun for 3 or more players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each round, one lucky player gets to be the Charlatan and blend in with the rest of you, trying to figure out
        the secret word without getting caught. The secret word will be revealed and then each player, including the
        Charlatan, will take turns saying one word related to the secret word. Be careful with your words, as the
        Charlatan will be trying to blend in.
      </p>
      <p>
        After everyone's had a go, it's time for the real fun to begin! The debate starts and it's time for you to ear
        apart each other's arguments. If the player with the most votes is indeed the Charlatan, they'll have to take a
        guess at the secret word.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Charlatan slips through undetected, they'll score a cheeky 2 points, but everyone else scores nada. If
        the Charlatan is caught but guesses the secret word, they'll score 1 point and everyone else scores 0 points.
        But, if the Charlatan is caught and can't guess the secret word, they'll score 0 points and everyone else scores
        a brilliant 2 points. The first player to score 5 points is the winner! Good luck and keep your eyes peeled.
