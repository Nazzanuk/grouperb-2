      <h3>Defuse: The Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Gather round, people! It's time to put your nerves to the test and save the day. You're on a mission to defuse a
        bomb before time runs out, and you're going to need to work together to make it happen.
      </p>
      <p>Here's the deal</p>
      <p>
        There are 6 colorful wires that need to be cut in the right order to defuse the bomb. But the instructions on
        how to do it are scattered amongst you players. So, you'll need to communicate and coordinate like a well-oiled
        machine to make sure you're following the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure you're following the instructions carefully. If you cut the wrong wire or cut them out of order, you
        could activate the bomb, and that's game over. You're also working against the clock, so you'll need to act fast
        and work efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>Remember, you're a team, so listen to each other and respect the instructions you've been given.</p>{' '}
      <p>Communication is key!</p>
      <p>Now, let's get to it! The fate of all good people rests in your hands.</p>

      <h3>Vote: The Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Attention all players! It's time to put your camaraderie to the acid test with Vote. This multiplayer game will
        reveal the true colors of your friends, but fret not, victory is but a mere afterthought. The real goal is to
        have a jolly good time, filled with cheeky banter and intriguing anecdotes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each round, a question shall be posed, for instance "Who is most likely to purchase a scarlet sports car?" and
        then it will be your duty to vote for the individual you believe fits the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
        But beware, the catch is that you'll only earn a point for your vote if it coincides with the general consensus.
        Hence, choose wisely!
      </p>

      <p>
        This jamboree is all about making merry and getting to know one another a bit better. So, bring your wit and a
        hearty laugh, and get ready for some old-fashioned hijinks. And remember, no matter the outcome, you'll
        (probably) still be friends till the end.
      </p>

      <p>Alright, let the games begin! Who's ready for the challenge?</p>

      <h3>Charlatan: The Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to Charlatan, the cheeky multiplayer game where you will have to outsmart each other and sniff out the
        game's sneaky Charlatan. This game is good fun for 3 or more players.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each round, one lucky player gets to be the Charlatan and blend in with the rest of you, trying to figure out
        the secret word without getting caught. The secret word will be revealed and then each player, including the
        Charlatan, will take turns saying one word related to the secret word. Be careful with your words, as the
        Charlatan will be trying to blend in.
      </p>
      <p>
        After everyone's had a go, it's time for the real fun to begin! The debate starts and it's time for you to tear
        apart each other's arguments. If the player with the half or more votes is indeed the Charlatan, they'll have to
        take a guess at the secret word.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Charlatan slips through undetected, they'll score a cheeky 2 points (3 if they receive 0 votes), and
        everyone else scores nada. If the Charlatan is caught but guesses the secret word, they'll score 1 point and
        everyone else scores 0 points. But, if the Charlatan is caught and can't guess the secret word, they'll score 0
        points and everyone else scores a brilliant 2 points. The first player to score 7 points is the winner! Good
        luck and keep your eyes peeled.

      <h3>Flow: The Rules</h3>
      <p>Introducing Flow, a delightful game that will engage you and your friends in a fun, interactive challenge.</p>
      <p>
        The objective is clear: you have these charming blocks cascading down your screen, and it's your task to tap
        them precisely when they reach the two horizontal lines. Your accuracy and timing are crucial, as they'll earn
        you more points.
      </p>
      <p>
        While you'll be racking up points individually, it's the combined team score that really matters. And don't get
        too comfortable, because with each round, the game becomes slightly more demanding as the blocks fall at a
        faster pace.
      </p>
      <p>Get ready for some team based button bashing!</p>

      <h3>Blocks: The Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Presenting Blocks, a delightful and engaging game that brings friends together in a colourful test of intellect
        and teamwork.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its core, it's a simple concept: there's a grid with a specific arrangement of coloured blocks that form the
        solution.
      </p>

      <p>
        In each round, one player is designated as the Solver, and the catch is, they can't see the solution. The answer
        is distributed among the other players, and it's up to the team to collaborate, communicate, and guide the
        Solver towards success.
      </p>
      <p>
        But don't dilly-dally! You're racing against the clock, so make the most of your time while keeping a keen eye
        on the ticking seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Blocks demands sharp wits, excellent communication, and the ability to work together harmoniously. Gather your
        comrades and prepare to tackle this vibrant challenge that's sure to provide hours of entertainment!
